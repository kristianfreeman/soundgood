## Audio Processing Details

SoundGood uses FFmpeg with the following audio chain:

1. **High-Pass Filter** - Removes rumble and low-frequency noise
2. **Dynamic Compression** - Evens out volume levels
3. **Loudness Normalization** - Ensures consistent playback volume across platforms

### Presets

- **Light**: Gentle enhancement for already good audio
- **Standard**: Balanced processing for most videos
- **Aggressive**: Strong processing for poor audio conditions
- **Ultra**: Maximum processing for challenging audio

## Troubleshooting

### "App can't be opened" on macOS
The app isn't code-signed yet. Right-click the app and select "Open" to bypass Gatekeeper.

### Video won't process
- Ensure your video has an audio track
- Try a different video format (MP4 recommended)
- Check the console for error messages

### Audio sounds distorted
- Try a lighter preset
- Reduce the compression ratio
- Lower the makeup gain
